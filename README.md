## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Visual & UI Highlights
* **Command Cyber Dark & Clean Light Themes:** Anti-FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) instant localStorage theme detector supporting both cybernetic command-center dark mode and ultra-crisp corporate light mode.
* **Live CCTV OSD Simulation:** Real-time synchronized camera status overlay with live timestamp clock generator (`HH:MM:SS` 24/7 simulator).
* **Interactive Active Deterrence Showcase:** Demonstrates flashing red/blue strobe lights and two-way siren deterrence technologies.
* **Installation Proof & Standards:** Real job-site gallery showcasing wall-mounted Dahua PTZ dome installations (`image8.png`) and clean rack cable management.
* **Brand-Themed Floating Action Button:** Floating Back-to-Top button styled with brand gradient glow ring (`#2563EB` to `#06B6D4`), adaptive light/dark glassmorphic core, and auto-hiding scroll controller.
* **Zero Layout Shift Carousel:** Synchronized hero carousels with matched aspect ratios (`aspect-[941/1304]`) ensuring seamless, jump-free slide cross-fades.

### 💼 Conversion & Lead Capture
* **Zero-Plugin Web3Forms Integration:** Native, direct API integration sending quote inquiries to dispatch via client-configured access keys without heavy WordPress or external form plugins.
* **Pre-filled Package Inquiries:** Clicking package buttons (*4-Camera 4K ColorVu*, *8-Camera Commercial*, etc.) automatically focuses and pre-populates the quote form.
* **Sub-Second Performance:** 100% static pre-rendered HTML delivering near-instant First Contentful Paint (FCP) and perfect Lighthouse performance scores.
